<h2>What's Blazing Tales? </h2>
 
           <p class="indented">Blazing Tales is a book on storytelling. If role-playing games were hiking trails, Blazing Tales gives you the power to blaze your own. It teaches a system for writing and roleplaying stories that is ultra-fast and open-ended. You have complete control over your character's actions. Instead of rolling to see if you do something cool, you roll after you do something cool to find out what the narrative result will be. Like branching paths in a story, with every roll Blazing Tales twists the plot in new and exciting directions. With this narrative driven system, Blazing Tales frees you to define your characters according to your imagination rather than attributes and dice rolls. Whether you are writing a story or improvising with friends Blazing Tales helps you figure out what happens next so you never get stuck with writer's block again.</p>
		  
        <p class="indented">Are you in the mood for a sprawling adventure, a small-town mystery, or a classic dungeon crawl? The Blazing Tales storytelling engine handles anything you can imagine. 
		The system automatically handles story pacing, narrative flow, and shared cooperative storytelling structure with one dice roll. So you only need focus on being creative.</p>
