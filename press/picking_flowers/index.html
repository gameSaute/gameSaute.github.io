							<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
                            <p>In 2014 Sage made a little game about collecting gems and falling pits. The graphics were crude, there was no strategy, and yet Sage found themselves in times of of anxiety and inattention coming back to the game, as would others. They played it thousands of times. The game was a practice of focus to avoid accidentally stepping into one of the pits. The longer you could focus the higher your score would be. It both trained focus and by focusing one was able to temporaily push out all the thoughts of the future in their head and return to present. </p>
           <p>Sage wanted to be able to make the game more accessible to other people and share this thing that helps them so much. </p> 
          <p> When Basil said they wanted to try making a video game with Sage in 2017, The choice was obvious, A remastered version of this game we all love so much. This is that game, Picking Flowers. A game Sage loves remasted with art by someone Sage loves. We hope you enjoy playing as the two of us running around grabbing flowers.</p> <p> -Sage </p>
